## üìã Technical Overview

This kernel driver demonstrates how `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` protection can be bypassed at the kernel level by hooking the `NtUserSetWindowDisplayAffinity` system call and forcing the display affinity flags to `0x00000000`.

### How It Works
1. Loads as a kernel driver using Windows service infrastructure
2. Hooks system calls via Circular Kernel Context Logger (CKCL)
3. Intercepts `NtUserSetWindowDisplayAffinity` calls
4. Modifies protection flags to disable screenshot prevention
5. Returns control to original system call

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 x64
- Administrator privileges
- Test Mode or disabled Driver Signature Enforcement

### Quick Start
```batch
# Enable test mode (one-time, requires restart)
bcdedit /set testsigning on

# Load driver
load_driver.bat

# Verify bypass is working
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\verify_bypass.ps1
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection & Mitigation

### For Security Teams
To detect this or similar bypasses:
- Monitor for test signing mode: `bcdedit | findstr testsigning`
- Check for unsigned kernel drivers: `driverquery /si | findstr "FALSE"`
- Audit system call hooks via WPA/ETW
- Implement kernel patch protection monitoring
- Use EDR solutions with kernel-level visibility

### Defensive Recommendations
1. Enable Secure Boot and UEFI
2. Implement driver allowlisting via WDAC
3. Monitor for kernel modifications
4. Use Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI)
5. Deploy kernel-level security solutions

## üìö Academic References

This research builds upon:
- "Windows Kernel Programming" by Pavel Yosifovich
- "Rootkits and Bootkits" by Alex Matrosov et al.
- Microsoft's documentation on Windows display protection
- CVE research on kernel-level bypasses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

**Impact on System Security:**
- Reduces overall system security posture
- May trigger PatchGuard on certain configurations
- Could conflict with anti-cheat systems
- Leaves forensic artifacts in event logs

**Responsible Disclosure:**
- This technique has been known since Windows 10 introduction
- Microsoft is aware of kernel-level bypass possibilities
- Requires administrative/kernel privileges (not a privilege escalation)
